# Folder Cleanup Tool

This tool recursively searches through a specified directory to find and delete folders that contain only an image file and no subdirectories.

## Requirements

- Go installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.go` file.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.go`.
3. Run the script with the command: `go run main.go <path_to_directory>` replacing `<path_to_directory>` with the path of the directory you want to search through.

Note: Use this tool with caution. It will delete folders that meet the specified criteria without further confirmation.
